# 👋 Hello 🌎, I'm Mattia!
🗿 _I sweat, program and climb rocks_

🧑‍💻 I’m a **Ph.D. Student in Robotics** at the [ARSControl Lab](https://www.arscontrol.unimore.it/), Italy 🇮🇹.

🔎 My research interests are in Multi-Robot Systems and Swarm Robotics.\
Currently, my focus is on Path Planning, Aut. Exploration and Coverage Control.

### 🏝️ This is literally me: 
- I love being out in nature exploring new places 🏞️.
- If I am not lifting weights 🏋️, I am probably climbing rocks 🧗 or cycling 🚴.
- Big fan of anime 🎌 and pizza 🍕.
- Also, I rescue people as a volunteer in the Italian Red Cross 🚑.

### 🤖 ProjectRED
![ProjectRED](/images/projectred.jpeg){: .align-right width="300px"}
I have been working on the [ProjectRED](https://www.projectred.it/) 🚀 project, a student-led initiative at the [University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, DISMI](https://www.dismi.unimore.it/it).\
👉 The project aims to develop a rover for competing in the [European Rover Challenge (ERC)](https://roverchallenge.eu/) competition.\

During the 2023 season, I led the Robotics Division ⚙️ managing the amazing guys on the team. Priori to that, I contributed to the division, focusing on the development of the rover's software architecture and control algorithms.
