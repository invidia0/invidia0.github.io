🧑‍💻 I’m a **Ph.D. Student in Robotics** at the [ARSControl Lab](https://www.arscontrol.unimore.it/), University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy 🇮🇹.

🔎 My research interests are in Control Theory, AI applied to Robotics and Multi-Robot Systems.

Recently, I've worked on coverage control with unkown spatial processes estimation, employing Gaussian Processes (GPs).

Currently, my focus is on Nonlinear control techniques (NMPC), specifically applied to quadrotors; Coverage and Ergodic Control;
A short list of tools that I'm familiar with:
- Python, C/C++, MATLAB
- ROS, ROS 2, PyTorch, Tensorflow, JAX and the main libraries like NumPy, GPy, Pyro, etc. (Also a bit of RL with Gymnasium, SB3 and MuJoCo)
- Ubuntu based.

### 🏝️ This is literally me: 
- I love being out in nature exploring new places 🏞️.
- If I am not lifting weights 🏋️, I am probably climbing rocks 🧗 or pushing watts 🏃‍♂️🚴.\

- Big fan of sushi and pizza 🍕.
- Also, I rescue people as a volunteer in the Italian Red Cross 🚑.

### 🤖 ProjectRED
![ProjectRED](/images/projectred.jpeg){: .align-right width="300px"}
I have been working on the [ProjectRED](https://www.projectred.it/) 🚀 project, a student-led initiative at the [University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, DISMI](https://www.dismi.unimore.it/it).\
👉 The project aims to develop a rover for competing in the [European Rover Challenge (ERC)](https://roverchallenge.eu/) competition.\

In the 2023 season, I took charge of the **Robotics Division** ⚙️, leading a talented team. Together, we focused on enhancing the system architecture of the rover and developing the interface to manage all robotics sub-systems. This encompassed tasks such as refining the robotic arm, sample drill, BMS logging, autonomous navigation and localization. This experience allowed me to further develop my **leadership skills** and proficiency with **ROS/ROS 2**, **Python**, **C/C++**, STM32, CAN Bus, and various communication protocols.
